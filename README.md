## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This is getting easier and easier each time I engage in a challenge as I didn't have to check out any solution so I struggled a little in the process. But it was fine and definitely fun.


```css
.pay{
    background-color: hsl(245, 75%, 52%);
    color: white;
    box-shadow: 0 15px 20px 0 hsla(245, 75%, 52%, .25);
    opacity: 1;
    width: 79%;
    padding: 1rem 1.7rem 1rem 1.7rem;
    border-radius: 7px;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm a little better at these and, also, more familiar with putting stuff I learn into practical working so I'm going to move on to more challenging like cloning a website.

### Useful resources
